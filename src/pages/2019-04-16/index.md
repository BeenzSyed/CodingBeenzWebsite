Security testing is a testing technique that determines whether an application can protect its data and maintain its functionality.

</br>Security testing covers the following:
</br>1Ô∏è‚É£Confidentiality - protects against the disclosure of information to parties other than the intended recipient
</br>2Ô∏è‚É£Integrity - protects information from being modified by unauthorized parties
</br>3Ô∏è‚É£Authentication - confirming the identity of a person, it confirms who you are
</br>4Ô∏è‚É£Authorization - determining if a requester is allowed to receive a service or perform an operation, it figures out what you can do after you‚Äôve been authenticated
</br>5Ô∏è‚É£Availability - assuring information and communication services will be ready for use when expected
</br>6Ô∏è‚É£Non-repudiation - ensures that a transferred message has been sent and received by the parties claiming to have sent and received the message

</br>In the next few posts, I‚Äôll cover some of the ways that you can test for security!

</br>Happy Tuesday!! üòÅ
