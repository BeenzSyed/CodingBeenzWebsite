I finished a first draft of resume and I also published my medium article about resume tips for developers! Check it out!

I hope this article helps and let me know if there are any tips that you all think are helpful in the comments!

Here is my <u>[resume](resume.pdf)</u> as an example as well.

Happy Friday! I wish you all a great weekend! üòÅ
