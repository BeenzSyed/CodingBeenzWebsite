Hi All! Today’s topic is: How SSH connections work
🔸
This will bring together the 3 types of encryption techniques - symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption and hashing (my 3 previous posts detail these out).
🔸
1️⃣A symmetric key is generated using the Diffie-Helman key exchange algorithm (which utilizes asymmetric encryption).
2️⃣This symmetric key is then used for the rest of the session to encrypt and exchange messages.
3️⃣Hashing is used to ensure each message has not been tampered with.
🔸
At this point, the SSH connection has been established! However, the user that wants access to the remote server still needs to be authenticated. This is done using a password or a ssh key using RSA.
🔸
I’ll cover authentication in the next post.
🔸
I hope this has been helpful! Let me know if you have any questions and thank you for reading!!
🔸
Have a wonderful week!!
