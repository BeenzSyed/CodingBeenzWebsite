Authentication factors are the ways in which a user can be authenticated (verified that they are who they say they are).

There are 3 factors:
</br>1️⃣Knowledge factors - something the user knows (Ex. Password, pass phrase, security question)
</br>2️⃣Ownership factors - something the user has (Ex. Cell phone, ID card, security token)
</br>3️⃣Inherence factors - something the user is (Ex. Fingerprint, retinal pattern, DNA sequence and other biometric identifiers)

Single-factor authentication is the weakest level of authentication that uses only one of the above. Normally, you’ll see that it’s from the knowledge factor - using a password.

Two-factor authentication is using two factors from the above. You’ll see that GitHub uses 2 factor auth which requires the user to know their password and a token which is generally obtained from their cell phone.

Multi-factor authentication involves two or more authentication factors. This is used where higher security is needed.
