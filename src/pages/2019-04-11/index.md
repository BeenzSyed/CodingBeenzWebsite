Let’s talk about performance testing today.🤓
</br>Performance testing is done to ensure that the application under test can perform well under load. When running unit/functional/integration tests, you ensure that the features are working correctly for one user. What happens when you have thousands of users? To figure that out, you do performance testing.
</br>🌼
</br>Generally performance testing focuses on 3 parts:
</br>1️⃣Speed/Response times - does my application respond within a reasonable amount of time when it’s under load?
</br>2️⃣Scalability - what is the maximum amount of users that my application can handle?
</br>3️⃣Stability - can my application sustain a minimum workload over a long period of time?
</br>🌼
</br>I’ll go through the different types of performance testing in the next post!
