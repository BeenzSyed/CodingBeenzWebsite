Todayâ€™s topic: Encryption

The purpose of encryption is to transform data in order to keep it secret from others. For example, securely sending a password over the network. The goal is to ensure the data cannot be consumed by anyone other than the intended recipient.

Encryption transforms data into another format in such a way that only specific individuals can reverse the transformation. It uses a key, which is kept secret in conjunction with the data (plaintext) and the algorithm to perform the encryption operation (cipher). The cipher text (encrypted data), algorithm and the key are all required to return the data to plaintext.

Examples of algorithms are: AES and RSA
