Continuing the performance testing posts, I'll cover the different types today. There are quite a few, I'll talk about the 3 most common ones.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

</br>1Ô∏è‚É£Load testing - checks your application‚Äôs ability to perform under the average/normal load. In production, if your application gets an average of 50 transactions per second (tps), then you will test your app against 50 tps and see what happens. If you have an application that gets high traffic, it‚Äôs a good idea to include a load test in your CI/CD pipeline to see how performance is effected with each release.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
</br>2Ô∏è‚É£Stress testing - determines where the breakpoint of your app is. In this test, you slowly increase the transactions per second to see how much load your app can handle before something breaks. This is helpful to figure out what rate limits to put on your application. Rate limits protect your application from hitting the breakpoint. When the rate limit is reached, you can set a notification to your users stating that the rate limit has been reached and to try again later. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
</br>3Ô∏è‚É£Endurance/stability testing - this test is generally run with the average load over a long period of time. This helps to determine if there are any memory leaks or anything else that can break over time.‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
