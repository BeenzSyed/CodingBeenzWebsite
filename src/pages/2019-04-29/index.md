Simply put, authentication is verifying a user's identity while authorization is verifying what a user has access to.

Authentication is about validating your credentials such as a username and password to verify your identity. The system will then check to see whether you are who you say you are using the credentials you entered. There are different authentication factors that can be used to verify a user’s identity, I’ll cover those in the next post.

Authorization takes place after a user has been successfully authenticated by the system. Authorization is the process that determines what resources a user has access to. An example of this is determining if the user is an admin or a basic user. Admin users will have access to more resources compared to a basic user.
